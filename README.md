# breastCancerML-LogisticRegression
A Logistic Regression Machine Learning model created from the breast cancer data set directly imported from the Python package Scikit-Learn and SoloLearn's Machine Learning curriculum.
The Python packages used in this project include NumPy, pandas, and Scikit-learn.
The NumPy package is used to create arrays of data values and features a whole array of arithmetic operations and functions to perform on such data.
The pandas package allows for the cleaning and organization of data into DataFrame structures and series.
Scikit-learn is a package that allows for the performance of machine learning models on the data.
In this project, the model chosen was the Logistic Regression model.
Learning was supervised learning based off Scikit-Learn's breast_cancer data set.
